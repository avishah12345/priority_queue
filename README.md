# priority_queue
Run functions based on their priority. Higher priority functions are run first, followed by lower priority ones.

## Why would one want to use a _priority queue_?
This concept saved one of NASA's moon missions. The computer focused on the problem first, then the other basic tasks. Although functionally not required, it is useful in cases where errors are common.

Refer to py file for usage.
